# Preparations for every race

## Zwift Power

If you are racing you will be assigned to one of the teams. For your race results to be counted at wtrl.racing
you will need to ensure that the team you are racing on appears at the end of the name on Zwift Power. If you are racing on the SRT4 team your name should end with ` (STR4)`

## Race Signup

You will need to ensure that you are signed up to the correct race and pen in Zwift. We will tell you which 
event and pen to join based on your team assignment.  


## Race Day
1. Please test comms when warming up.
2. Make sure you are warmed up and in the pen 5 minutes before the event is scheduled to start.  There is no late join for WTRL TTT events so even if you are waiting for 10 minutes after the banner drop to start your race you must be in the pen.
3. Stop pedalling 15 seconds before the banner drops to ensure that you aren't putting out any power and move accidentally.
4. Do not pedal until your scheduled start delay. 
5. Someone will countdown to when you can start pedalling, when it reaches zero, drop the watts.
6. Quickly get into formation.  Try and get into a line and try not to overlap other riders.  Try not to race your team.
7. When passing other teams you should be prepared to push a bit harder to get past them and break any sticky draft.  You must not draft them or the team may get disqualified. If you are overtaken by a group then let them go, don't hold they draft. 
8. The team time is taken for the fourth rider over the line.  
9. If you are struggling say something. Don't force yourself to keep pushing and hurt yourself.  There is no shame if pulling up.  
10. And, most importantly, have fun!
