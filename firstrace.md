# Preparations for your first race

## Zwift Power

You will need to sign up to [Zwift Power](https://zwiftpower.com/) and join the 
[Sunrise Racing Team](https://zwiftpower.com/team.php?id=11789). You should set this team to be your primary team.

## WTRL

This step is optional but recommended.  Visit [wtrl.racing](https://wtrl.racing/) and register.  From the WTRL 
website you can see the [upcoming events](https://www.wtrl.racing/ttt/TTT-Event.php) and once assigned to a team they
provide a link to join the correct event.

## Strava

If you are a member of Strava you can join the [SRT club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/SRTracing).

## Intervals.icu

You may want to sign up for [Intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu/) and connect it to Strava or Garmin Connect.

## WhatsApp

Most communication is done over WhatsApp.  The main group chat can be extensive so you may want to mute for that group.  You will be invited to the groups you need to be in.

## Discord

During races teams will communicate over [Discord](https://discord.com/). You should get this installed before your
first race, and links will be sent to join the channel.
